      <h3>Arsenal Fc</h3>
      <p>
        What is it? <br>
        Arsenal Football Club, commonly referred to as Arsenal, is a professional football club based in Islington, North London, England. Founded in 1886, the club is one of the oldest and most successful in English football history. Arsenal plays its home games at the Emirates Stadium, which has been their home since 2006, though they previously played at Highbury for over 90 years.  
      </p>
      <p>
        What is football/soccer?<br>
        Football (soccer) is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players. Players almost exclusively use their feet to propel a ball around a rectangular field called a pitch. The objective of the game is to score more goals than the opposing team by moving the ball beyond the goal line into a rectangular-framed goal defended by the opposing team. Traditionally, the game is played over two 45-minute halves, for a total match time of 90 minutes. With an estimated 250 million players active in over 200 countries and territories, it is the world's most popular sport.

      <h3>Characteristics of Arsenal FC</h3>
      <p>
        Does the club have a nickname & logo?<br>
        Arsenal's nickname is "The Gunners", in honor of the Royal Arsenal munitions factory in Woolwich, south-east London, where the club's founders worked. Its logo, which features the iconic cannon, is also a reference to this factory and the club's history. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What are the club's primary colors?<br>
        Arsenal's home colors are red and white for a number of reasons, including a donation from Nottingham Forest (a neighboring football club) and the club's budget at the time of its founding. Shortly after Arsenal was founded in 1886, Nottingham Forest donated red shirts to the club. Due to budget constraints, when Nottingham Forest players joined Arsenal (or Dial FC at the time), they brought their red kit with them. Since the club was on a tight budget, it was cheaper to outfit the entire team in red.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where does the football club play?<br>
        Arsenal FC used to play home games at Arsenal Stadium, also known as Highbury, from 1913 until 2006. Due to wanting a larger stadium that could fit more spectators, the club then moved to Emirates Stadium, a new stadium with a capacity of over 60,000, in the Holloway district of Islington.
