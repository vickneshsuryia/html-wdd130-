                <h2>How successful is Arsenal FC?</h2>
                <p>
                    Arsenal is renowned for its rich history and tradition of success, both domestically and internationally. The club has won 13 English league titles, making it one of the most successful clubs in the Premier League era. Their most remarkable achievement came in the 2003-04 season, when they went through the entire Premier League campaign unbeaten, a feat not matched in English top-flight football for decades. The club has also won 14 FA Cups, the most by any team in the competition's history, and multiple League Cups, Community Shields, and European trophies, including the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup (now UEFA Europa League) in 1970.
